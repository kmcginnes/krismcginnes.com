# Developer Portfolio

[Kris McGinnes Portfolio](https://krismcginnes.com)

This is my developer portfolio website, which started as a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## Goals

My initial goal was to set up a blog. This is why I chose Next.js as the foundation.

If I were to start over from scratch I would likely chose Astro as the foundation instead.

The other goal was to be in full control over the look and feel. Performance and style were key priorities. My choice to use TailwindCSS was absolutely the right call and allowed me to move fast and tweak things.
